# ðŸ¥¬ BiteFresh

**BiteFresh** is your smart kitchen assistant designed to **reduce food waste** and **simplify grocery management**. By helping you track everything in your fridge and pantry, BiteFresh makes sure good food doesn't go bad. This was inspired by my experiences this year, sharing a fridge with roomates.
